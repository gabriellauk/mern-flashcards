# Flashcards
Flashcards is a full stack MERN application enabling users to create flashcards to help them memorise new concepts.

## Features
* Register, login and logout
* Start a revision session - view questions one at a time, flipping the card to reveal the answer. Choose to hide a card once you've memorised it (mark it as inactive) or move on to the next one
* Manage cards - add, update or delete your active and inactive cards

## Technologies
These are some of the technologies I used to create this:
* React
* React Router
* Axios
* Boostrap/CSS/SASS
* React Transition Group
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
